            <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p>KnpRadBundle is the central and single custom piece of the Symfony2 RAD edition. It articulates around an <a href="#app-bundle">application bundle</a>, including other neat features which you can read about below.</p>

            <p>The KnpRadBundle gives life to the RAD distribution of Symfony2. The RAD edition has the exact same project structure than a usual standard distribution. You can also use the KnpRadBundle just like any other bundle inside a Symfony2 project, enabling only features that you like.</p>

            <p>On the first read, you might think that we're breaking conventions here or trying to produce a new main distribution of Symfony2. It's really not the case. We're just trying to show how easy it is to configure Symfony2 for your needs and create custom distribution with only one bundle. We're solving our own development flow problems here and we hope that many developers out there will share our opinions on development process.</p>

            <p>Have fun!</p>

            <h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>composer.phar create-project knplabs/rad-edition my-project</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                After you'll do this step, you'll have an empty project, generated for you with
                really useful defaults, like default view, based on
                <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate 3.0</a> and Twitter Bootstrap 2.0
                forms layout. Then you'll just need to start coding.
